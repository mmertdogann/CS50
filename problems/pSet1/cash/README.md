# Cash

Implement, in `cash.c` at right, a program that first asks the user how much change is owed and then prints the minimum number of coins with which that change can be made.

## Specification
- Use `get_float `to get the user’s input and `printf` to output your answer. Assume that the only coins available are quarters (25¢), dimes (10¢), nickels (5¢), and pennies (1¢).
    - We ask that you use `get_float` so that you can handle dollars and cents, albeit sans dollar sign. In other words, if some customer is owed $9.75 (as in the case where a newspaper costs 25¢ but the customer pays with a $10 bill), assume that your program’s input will be `9.75` and not `$9.75` or `975`. However, if some customer is owed $9 exactly, assume that your program’s input will be `9.00` or just `9` but, again, not `$9` or `900`. Of course, by nature of floating-point values, your program will likely work with inputs like `9.0` and `9.000` as well; you need not worry about checking whether the user’s input is “formatted” like money should be.
- You need not try to check whether a user’s input is too large to fit in a `float`. Using `get_float` alone will ensure that the user’s input is indeed a floating-point (or integral) value but not that it is non-negative.
- If the user fails to provide a non-negative value, your program should re-prompt the user for a valid amount again and again until the user complies.
- So that we can automate some tests of your code, be sure that your program’s last line of output is only the minimum number of coins possible: an integer followed by `\n`.
- Beware the inherent imprecision of floating-point values. Recall `floats.c` from class, wherein, if `x` is `2`, and `y` is `10`, `x / y` is not precisely two tenths! And so, before making change, you’ll probably want to convert the user’s inputted dollars to cents (i.e., from a `float` to an `int`) to avoid tiny errors that might otherwise add up!
- Take care to round your cents to the nearest penny, as with `round`, which is declared in `math.h`. For instance, if `dollars` is a `float` with the user’s input (e.g., `0.20`), then code like `int cents = round(dollars * 100);` will safely convert `0.20` (or even `0.200000002980232238769531250`) to `20`.


## Usage
Your program should behave per the examples below.

```
$ ./cash
Change owed: 0.41
4
```

```
$ ./cash
Change owed: -0.41
Change owed: foo
Change owed: 0.41
4
```
